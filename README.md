# AlLogic

## About:

Combinational Logic Circuit Design Language  
Basic constructs: only AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etcâ€¦  
Define, declare, and invoke complex circuits using these

## Features:

- Defined gates can be used to define subsequent gates, allowing for abstraction
- Declared circuits are evaluated using a graph traversal, rather than a boolean expression
- Import statements allow multiple files worth of definitions for better organization

## Setup instructions:
- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/alexproc03/AlLogic.git` or `git clone git@github.com:alexproc03/AlLogic.git`
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install dependencies: `pip install textX`
- Run the project via terminal with '.al' file as target `python AlLogic.py <.al file>`
